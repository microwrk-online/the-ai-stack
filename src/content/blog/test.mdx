## First-day feels

You just walked past the **“Top Engineering College”** board at the gate—only to realise the **comma is missing** between “Top” and “Engineering”.  
Your hostel Wi-Fi password is literally **“password123”**, and the mess serves _“Paneer Surprise”_—surprise: there’s no paneer.

If that made you chuckle, congrats—you’re in the right place.

## Pain-point bingo 🎯

| Pain                                              | Meme Level |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Relatives asking “IIT kaunsa?”                    | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| Internship portal auto-filters out your college   | 🔥🔥🔥     |
| Wi-Fi dies when attendance sheet reaches your row | 🔥🔥🔥🔥   |

## The comeback trailer

- **Week-1**: Fix the Wi-Fi (literally).
- **Week-2**: Deploy your first mini-project and post it on LinkedIn.
- **Week-3**: Land your first DM from a recruiter—**not your relative**.

> “Tier-3 isn’t a label, it’s a launchpad—just a really noisy one.”
