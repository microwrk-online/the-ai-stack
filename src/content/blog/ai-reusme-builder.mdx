## 🧠 The Problem

Most resumes are broken.

They're generic, keyword-stuffed messes that get ignored by both ATS systems *and* hiring managers.

Job seekers are tired of guessing what to write.

> “Does this sound professional?”  
> “Is it too wordy?”  
> “Will a recruiter even care?”

That's where an **AI Resume Optimizer** comes in.

## 💡 The Idea

Build a simple tool that lets users paste their resume + a job description.

Then, let AI do the heavy lifting:

✅ Rewrites bullet points with stronger verbs  
✅ Adds ATS-friendly keywords  
✅ Cuts fluff and improves clarity  
✅ Personalizes for the role and industry  
✅ Gives a confidence score from 1–10

Want more power?

Ask users:
- “Are you switching careers?”
- “Entry-level or senior role?”
- “Any specific skills to highlight?”

Now it's not just rewriting — it's **strategizing**.
